This is a traning project for HTML and CSS. The asignment is to create a Google Homepage clone.

This was a very useful project that helped me:
- get valuable practice time with Git,
- learn to develop something that already has a design,
- practice and learn more about flexbox,
- learn more about positioning and sizing in general.
